# gflows
Git/GitHub workflow scripts for rapid and parallel team development

### Installation
Symlink `gflow.py` into `~/bin/gflow`, or somewhere else in your `$PATH`.
Invoke as `gflow up`, etc.

Optionally, you can symlink it multiple times with different names, 
those names corresponding to the names of commands: `up`, `land` etc.
Then you can invoke the command directly as `up` or `land` without the preceding `gflow`.
